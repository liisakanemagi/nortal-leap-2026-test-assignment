# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's 
just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

Used AI as a support tool:

1. Understanding existing code and writing action comments  
   – Used AI to get line-by-line explanations of the LibraryService class, which helped me understand unfamiliar 
    patterns and decide where changes were needed.
2. Validating my approach  
   – Used AI to sanity-check my understanding and identify missing edge cases before implementation.
3. Getting hints
   - Used AI to get hints and guiding questions when I was unsure about the correct approach, to help me think through 
   the solution myself.
