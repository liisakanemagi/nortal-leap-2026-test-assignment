# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's 
just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

Used AI as a support tool:

1. Understanding existing code and writing action comments  
   – Used AI to get line-by-line explanations of the LibraryService class, which helped me understand unfamiliar 
    patterns and decide where changes were needed.
